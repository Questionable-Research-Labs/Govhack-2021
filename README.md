A web app designed to allow everyone easy and user-friendly access to a map of COVID-19
locations of interest.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building


```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
